# Hi-Low_game

## Project Description
This project is a DOM based game assigned in the Per Scholas Software Engineering program. It is modeled after the traditional casino card game, Hi-Lo, where the goal is to correctly guess if the next card to be dealt will be higher or lower. A correct guess wins while an incorrect guess loses. Just like the traditional card game, players will need to correctly guess if the new number will be higher or lower than the live number. Both numbers range between 1 and 100. Players will need to score at least 500 points in order to win the game while only being allowed 3 wrong choices. As per project directions, this was programmed only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with most components being created via DOM manipulation. Lastly, please feel free to check back periodically as the project will continually undergo updates until indicated otherwise.

## Run the Project
Access the project by visiting the live site here at https://mingram8907.github.io/Hi-Low_game/

## How To Play
Adhere to the following instructions for the best experience of this version:
1. Click the Deal button to generate the Live Number that will be the reference from which you will need to guess if the Next Number will be higher or lower.
2. Make your guess by clicking either the Higher or Lower buttons that will generate the New Number which will reveal the result of your selection as well the points awarded for the round.
3. Begin the next round by clicking the Next Round button which will clear both number displays. Go back to step 1 to complete the round and continue until a winner is declared.
4. Refresh the page to begin/start a new game. 

Scoring: Points are awarded to the winner of each round. The loser of the round will receive no points. The amount of points awarded is the difference between the Live Number and the New Number. Points are accumulated and displayed in the scoreboard. The first to accumulate 500 points will be declared the winner of the game. Players will begin each game with 3 lives. Each round players lose will cost 1 life. Players lose the game once all lives are lost.

## Credits
- I reviewed the "How To Build A Simple Card Game with JavaScript" YouTube tutorial by Web Dev Simplified as a reference and loose model for mostly all of the programming for this project. The link to that video is here: https://youtu.be/NxRwIZWjLtE
- Per Scholas SE instructors Laura and Colton provided guidance/assistance on the fine tuning of button properties, scoring system, and displays.
